New API proposal:

Suggestions for readme:

Level1 attempts to make it as easy as possible to create 2D games using javascript.

It takes pixi and adds a game loop with the concept of entities and behaviours. Thatâ€™s it.

Text style
https://pixijs.io/pixi-text-style/#

Particles
<Insert particle editor>

Sound
<Insert sound generator>

Entity modifier functions are auto-curried and easily composable.

Behavior config should be returned from functions, to make sure a unique copy is created every time.
