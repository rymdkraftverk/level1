Move eslint config to root and share it for all projects??

Move docs to their respective projects

Render hitboxes have to be based on entity bounds not sprite bounds.

Separate setting and changing asset on an entity to prevent against accidentally override an asset

Should entity just be an asset????

Rename sprites to textures in assets.json??

Emitter should not be able to take a position option??

List emitter options in level1

Sprite with flipx/flipy should be used in template project

Add link to source code in docs?

Abstraction suggestion: hitbox
